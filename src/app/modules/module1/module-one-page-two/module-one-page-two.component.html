                What's all this Spacing?
            </h2>
            <p style="font-size: 2vh; paddingLeft: 3%; margin-right: 20%">
                Spacing is super important for any web page, it’s one of your best tools to make sure the content on the page is readable for everyone. There are few different parts that make up spacing, and it’s important to know where each one lies.

            <img src="../../../../assets/css box model 2.jfif" alt="Spacing Diagram" style="padding-left: 30px; height: 60vh; width: 100vh">
            <p style="font-size: 2vh; paddingLeft: 3%; margin-right: 20%">
                As you can see from the diagram, the margin is the outermost layer, the border is the middle layer, and the content is the innermost layer. The top, left, right, and bottom of each element can be changed individually to increase or decrease the spacing between other elements. 
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 2vh; paddingLeft: 3%; margin-right: 20%">
                For example, let’s say that you have two lines of text and a picture on your web page, and the picture is supposed to be to the right of the text. Let’s also imagine that the picture needs to be farther away from the text, but the second line needs to be closer to the first line. To make these changes, you could set the bottom margin of the first line, or the top margin of the second line, to be smaller. For the picture, you could set the right margins of the text to be larger than what it currently is, and these changes would accomplish the original goals.

            <p style="font-size: 2vh; paddingLeft: 3%; margin-right: 20%">
                To see this in practice, look at the below lines and see which ones you would prefer to look at.

                Another helpful tool for spacing is the line break tag: &lt;br /&gt;. This tag breaks the current line so you can start fresh on a new one. Here is an example of this:
